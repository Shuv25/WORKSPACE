Importance of Pandas in Python

Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floatin point data
Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and highe dimensional objects
Data set merging and joining. Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets Provide time-series functionality.


Series
Series : It is defined as a one-dimensional array that is capable of storing
various data types.
import pandas as pd
a = pd.Series( )
print(a)
