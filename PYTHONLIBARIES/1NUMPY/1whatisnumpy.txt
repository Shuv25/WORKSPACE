What is NumPy?
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
NumPy is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects.

What is NumPy Array ?
An array is a grid of values and it contains information about the raw data, how to locate an element, and how to interpret an element.

NumPy vs Python List
Advantages of using Numpy Arrays Over Python Lists:
consumes less memory.
fast as compared to the python List.
convenient to use.

Installation & Import NumPy

Installation NumPy
pip install numpy

Import NumPy
Import numpy as np


Importance of NumPy in Python
wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.
It supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that
operate on these arrays and matrices.
mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, 1/0, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.

Creating NumPy Arrays
To create a NumPy array, you can use the function np.array().
import numpy as np
a = np.array( [I, 2, 3] )
print( a )

Dimensions in Arrays
I-D Arrays
2-D Arrays
3-D Arrays
Higher Dimensional Arrays

Spacial NumPy Array
Ã„rray filled with O's
Array filled with I's
Create an empty array
An array with a range of elements
Array diagonal element filled with I's
Create an array with values that are spaced linearly in a specified interval

Create NumPy Arrays with Random Numbers
rand(): the function is used to generate a random value between O to I.
randn(): the function is used to generate a random value close to zero. This may return positive or negative numbers as well.
ranf(): the function for doing random sampling in numpy. It returns an array of specified shape and fills it with random floats in the half-open interval [0.0, 1.0).
randint( ) : the fuction is used to generate a random number be in a given range.

Copy vs View in NumPy Arrays

The Difference Between

                 Copy             and                  View 
The copy owns the data.                             The view does not own the data .

The copy of an array is a new                       A view of the original array.
array.

The changes made in the copy                        any changes made to the view will
affect the original array, and any                  data does not reflect in the original array.
changes made to the original
will affect the view.


NumPy Arrays Functions

Join Array : Joining means putting contents of two or more
arrays in a single array.
